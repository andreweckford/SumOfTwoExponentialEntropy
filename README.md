# SumOfTwoExponentialEntropy
These functions calculate the entropy of the random variable y=x+w, 
where x and w are independent but (possibly) non-identically-distributed
exponential random variables.

MATLAB version of the function: h_2_exponential.m
Python version of the function: h_2_exponential.py (requires scipy)
